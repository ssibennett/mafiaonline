    <h1 class="loading title">Wait</h1>
    <p>Tips:</p>
    <p>Mafia needs to act like citizen to not get cought.</p>
    <p>If you are a citizen, and have no job, that's the saddest thing that
       can happen in your life</p>
    <p>Police needs to find out who Mafia is, so the citizens can win</p>
    <p>I recommend doctors to heal yourself in the first night</p>
    <p>Mafias can trick citizens by telling fake things such as acting like a police. </p>
    <p>Mafia can kill themselves too!</p>
    <p>Police cannot find the jobs, but can find who the mafia is ;)</p>
    <p>I recommend the Doctors to heal the police officer, because they are the only one who can find the mafias</p>
    <p>There is 4 citizens, and 4 mafias in the game</p>
    <p>Mafias need to kill all the citizens to win</p>
    <p>Citizens can vote, and execute all the mafias to win</p>
    <p>The person who gets the most votes, they get executed</p>
    <p>You can still chat with the dead when you're dead btw</p>
